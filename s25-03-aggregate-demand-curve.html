            <li>What is the aggregate demand (AD) curve and what causes it to shift?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch22_s03_p01">Imagine a fixed IS curve and an LM curve shifting hard left due to increases in the price level, as in <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch22_s03_f01">Figure 22.6 "Deriving the aggregate demand curve"</a>. <em class="emphasis">As prices increase, Y falls and <em class="emphasis">i</em> rises</em>. Now plot that outcome on a new graph, where aggregate output Y remains on the horizontal axis but the vertical axis is replaced by the price level P. <em class="emphasis">The resulting curve, called the aggregate demand (AD) curve, will slope downward, as below. The AD curve is a very powerful tool because it indicates the points at which equilibrium is achieved in the markets for goods</em> and <em class="emphasis">money at a given price level</em>. It slopes downward because a high price level, ceteris paribus, means a small real money supply, high interest rates, and a low level of output, while a low price level, all else constant, is consistent with a larger real money supply, low interest rates, and kickinâ€™ output.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch22_s03_p02">Because the AD curve is essentially just another way of stating the IS-LM model, anything that would change the IS or LM curves will also shift the AD curve. More specifically, <em class="emphasis">the AD curve shifts in the same direction as the IS curve</em>, so it shifts right (left) with autonomous increases (decreases) in C, I, G, and NX and decreases (increases) in T. <em class="emphasis">The AD curve also shifts in the same direction as the LM curve</em>. So if MS increases (decreases), it shifts right (left), and if M<sub class="subscript">d</sub> increases (decreases) it shifts left (right), as in <a class="xref" href="wright-ch22_s01#wright-ch22_s01_f03">Figure 22.3 "Predicted effects of changes in major macroeconomic variables"</a>.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wright-ch22_s03_l02">
            <li>The aggregate demand curve is a downward sloping curve plotted on a graph with Y on the horizontal axis and the price level on the vertical axis.</li>
            <li>The AD curve represents IS-LM equilibrium points, that is, equilibrium in the market for both goods and money.</li>
            <li>It slopes downward because, as the price level increases, the LM curve shifts left as real money balances fall.</li>
            <li>AD shifts in the same direction as the IS or LM curves, so anything that shifts those curves shifts AD in precisely the same direction and for the same reasons.</li>

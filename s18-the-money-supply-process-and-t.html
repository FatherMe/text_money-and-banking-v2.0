    <p class="para editable block" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111111-140309-548103">In most countries today, a central bank or other monetary authority is charged with issuing domestic currency. That is an important charge because the supply of money greatly influences interest and inflation rates and, ultimately, aggregate output. If the central bank’s monetary policy is good, if it creates just the right amount of money, the economy will hum, and interest and inflation rates will be low. If it creates too much money too quickly, prices will increase rapidly and wipe out people’s savings until even the poorest people are nominal billionaires (as in Zimbabwe recently).<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111111-140309-548314"><a class="link" href="http://funkydowntown.com/poor-people-in-zimbabwe-are-millionaires-and-billionaires">funkydowntown.com/poor-people-in-zimbabwe-are-millionaires-and-billionaires</a>; <a class="link" href="http://www.hoax-slayer.com/zimbabwe-hyperinflation.shtml">www.hoax-slayer.com/zimbabwe-hyperinflation.shtml</a></span> If it creates too little money too slowly, prices will fall, wiping out debtors and making it nearly impossible to earn profits in business (as in the Great Depression). But even less extreme errors can have serious negative consequences for the economy and hence your wallets, careers, and dreams. This chapter is a little involved, but it is worth thoroughly understanding the money supply process and money multipliers if you want you and yours to be healthy and happy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch14_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Ultimately, the money supply is determined by the interaction of four groups: commercial banks and other depositories, depositors, borrowers, and the central bank</em>. Like any bank, the central bank’s balance sheet is composed of assets and liabilities. Its assets are similar to those of common banks and include government securities<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111111-140341-919180">Students sometimes become confused about this because they think the central bank <em class="emphasis">is</em> the government. At most, it is part of the government, and not the part that issues the bonds. Sometimes, as in the case of the BUS and SBUS, it is not part of the government at all.</span> and discount loans. The former provide the central bank with income and a liquid asset that it can easily and cheaply buy and sell to alter its balance sheet. The latter are generally loans made to commercial banks. So far, so good. <em class="emphasis">The central bank’s liabilities, however, differ fundamentally from those of common banks</em>. Its most important liabilities are currency in circulation and reserves.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch14_s01_p02">It may seem strange to see currency and reserves listed as liabilities of the central bank because those things are the <em class="emphasis">assets</em> of commercial banks. <em class="emphasis">In fact, for everyone but the central bank, the central bank’s notes, Federal Reserve notes (FRN) in the United States, are assets or things owned. But for the central bank, its notes are things owed (liabilities).</em> Every financial asset is somebody else’s liability, of course. A promissory note (IOU) that you signed would be your liability, but it would be an asset for the note’s holder or owner. Similarly, a bank deposit is a liability for the bank but an asset for the depositor. In like fashion, commercial banks own their deposits in the Fed (reserves), so they count them as assets. The Fed owes that money to commercial banks, so it must count them as liabilities. The same goes for FRN: the public <em class="emphasis">owns</em> them, but the Fed, as their issuer, <em class="emphasis">owes</em> them. (Don’t be confused by the fact that what the Fed owes to holders is nothing more than the right to use the notes to pay sums the holders owe to the government for taxes and the like.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch14_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">Currency in circulation (C) and reserves (R) compose the</em> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">monetary base</a><span class="glossdef">The most basic, powerful types of money in a given monetary system, that is, gold and silver under the gold standard, FRN, and reserves (Federal Reserve deposits) today.</span></span><em class="emphasis">(MB, aka high-powered money), the most basic building blocks of the money supply</em>. Basically, MB = C + R, an equation you’ll want to internalize. In the United States, C includes FRN and coins issued by the U.S. Treasury. We can ignore the latter because it is a relatively small percentage of the MB, and the Treasury cannot legally manage the volume of coinage in circulation in an active fashion, but rather only meets the demand for each denomination: .01, .05, .10, .25, .50, and 1.00 coins. (The Fed also supplies the $1.00 unit, and for some reason Americans prefer $1 notes to coins. In most countries, coins fill demand for the single currency unit denomination.) C includes only FRN and coins in the hands of nonbanks. Any FRN in banks is called vault cash and is included in R, which also includes bank deposits with the Fed. Reserves are of two types: those required or mandated by the central bank (RR), and any additional or excess reserves (ER) that banks wish to hold. The latter are usually small, but they can grow substantially during panics like that of September–October 2008.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch14_s01_p04">Central banks, of course, are highly profitable institutions because their assets earn interest but their liabilities are costless, or nearly so. Printing money en masse with modern technology is pretty cheap, and reserves are nothing more than accounting entries. Many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, now pay interest on reserves, but of course any interest paid is composed of cheap notes or, more likely, even cheaper accounting entries. Central banks, therefore, have no gap problems, and liquidity management is a snap because they can always print more notes or create more reserves. Central banks anachronistically own prodigious quantities of gold, but some have begun to sell off their holdings because they no longer convert their notes into gold or anything else for that matter.<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111111-141738-005458"><a class="link" href="http://news.goldseek.com/GoldSeek/1177619058.php">news.goldseek.com/GoldSeek/1177619058.php</a></span> Gold is no longer part of the MB but is rather just a commodity with unusually good monetary characteristics (high value-to-weight ratio, divisible, easily authenticated, and so forth).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch14_s02_p01">We are now ready to understand how the central bank influences the money supply (MS) with the aid of the T-accounts—accounts that show only the changes in balance sheets. Like regular balance sheets, however, T-accounts must balance (asset changes must equal liability changes). <em class="emphasis">Central banks like the Fed influence the MS via the MB. They control their monetary liabilities, MB, by buying and selling securities, a process called</em> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">open market operations</a><span class="glossdef">The purchase or sale of assets by a central bank in order to adjust the money supply. <em class="emphasis">See monetary base</em>.</span></span>. If a central bank wants to increase the MB, it need only buy a security. (Any asset will do, but securities, especially government bonds, are generally best because there is little default risk, liquidity is high, and they pay interest.) If a central bank bought a $10,000 bond from a bank, the following would occur:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch14_s02_p03">The central bank would gain $10,000 of securities essentially by creating $10,000 of reserves. Notice that the item transferred, securities, has opposite signs, negative for the banking system and positive for the central bank. That makes good sense if you think about it because one party is selling (giving up) and the other is buying (receiving). Note also that the central bank’s liability has the same sign as the banking system’s asset. That too makes sense because, as noted above, the central bank’s liabilities are everyone else’s assets. So if the central bank’s liabilities increase or decrease, everyone else’s assets should do likewise.</p>

            <li>MB is important because an increase (decrease) in it will increase (decrease) the money supply (M1—currency plus checkable deposits, M2—M1 plus time deposits and retail money market deposit accounts, etc.) by some multiple (hence the “high-powered” nickname).</li>
            <li>Open market operations occur whenever a central bank buys or sells assets, usually government bonds.</li>
            <li>By purchasing bonds (or anything else for that matter), the central bank increases the monetary base and hence, by some multiple, the money supply. (Picture the central bank giving up some money to acquire the bond, thereby putting FRN or reserves into circulation.)</li>
            <li>By selling bonds, the central bank decreases the monetary base and hence the money supply by some multiple. (Picture the central bank giving up a bond and receiving money for it, removing FRN or reserves from circulation.)</li>

        <p class="para" id="wright-ch14_s03_p14">Suppose the Federal Reserve wants to increase the amount of checkable deposits by $1,000,000 by conducting open market operations. Using the simple model of multiple deposit creation, determine what value of securities the Fed should purchase, assuming a required reserve ratio of 5 percent. What two major assumptions does the simple model of multiple deposit creation make? Show the appropriate equation and work.</p>
        <p class="para" id="wright-ch14_s03_p15">The Fed should purchase $50,000 worth of securities. The simple model of multiple deposit creation is △D = (1/rr) × △R, which of course is the same as △R = △D/(1/rr). So for this problem 1,000,000/(1/.05) = $50,000 worth of securities should be purchased. This model assumes that money is not held as cash and that banks do not hold excess reserves.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch14_s03_p16">Pretty easy, eh? <em class="emphasis">Too bad the simple deposit multiplier isn’t very accurate.</em> It provides an upper bound to the deposit creation process. The model simply isn’t very realistic. Sometimes banks hold excess reserves, and people sometimes prefer to hold cash instead of deposits, thereby stopping the multiple deposit creation process cold. If the original borrower, for example, had taken cash and paid it out to people who also preferred cash over deposits no expansion of the money supply would have occurred. Ditto if Some Bank had decided that it was too risky to make new loans and had simply exchanged its securities for reserves. Or if no one was willing to borrow. Those are extreme examples, but anywhere along the process leaks into cash or excess reserves sap the deposit multiplier. That is why, at the beginning of the chapter, we said that depositors, borrowers, and banks were also important players in the money supply determination process. In the next section, we’ll take their decisions into account.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wright-ch14_s03_l03">
            <li>The multiple deposit creation process works like this: say that the central bank buys $100 of securities from Bank 1, which lends the $100 in cash it receives to some borrower. Said borrower writes checks against the $100 in deposits created by the loan until all the money rests in Bank 2. Its deposits and reserves increased by $100, Bank 2 lends as much as it can, say (1 − rr = .9) or $90, to another borrower, who writes checks against it until it winds up in Bank 3, which also lends 90 percent of it. Bank 4 lends 90 percent of that, Bank 5 lends 90 percent of that, and so on, until a $100 initial increase in reserves has led to a $1,000 increase in deposits (and loans).</li>
            <li>The simple deposit multiplier is △D = (1/rr) × △R, where △D = change in deposits; △R = change in reserves; rr = required reserve ratio.</li>
            <li>The simple deposit multiplier assumes that banks hold no excess reserves and that the public holds no currency. We all know what happens when we assume or <em class="emphasis">ass</em>|u|<em class="emphasis">me</em>. These assumptions mean that the simple deposit multiplier overestimates the multiple deposit creation process, providing us with an upper-bound estimate.</li>

A private firm, however, can provide you with good estimates of changes in banking system reserves, and of course the required reserve ratio is well known.

In <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch15_s01_f02">Figure 15.3 "U.S. m"</a>, the M1 money multiplier m<sub class="subscript">1</sub> has indeed dropped considerably since about 1995. That could be caused by an increase in rr, C/D, or ER/D. <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch15_s01_f03">Figure 15.4 "U.S. currency and checkable deposits, 1959–2010"</a> shows that m decreased primarily because C/D increased. It also shows that the increase in C/D was due largely to the stagnation in D coupled with the continued growth of C. The stagnation in D is likely due to the advent of sweep accounts. <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch15_s01_f04">Figure 15.5 "U.S. currency ratio, 1959–2010"</a> isolates C/D for closer study.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wright-ch15_s01_l03">
            <li>The more sophisticated money multipliers are similar to the simple deposit multiplier in that they equate changes in the money supply to changes in the monetary base times some multiplier.</li>
            <li>The money multipliers differ because the simple multiplier is merely the reciprocal of the required reserve ratio, while the other multipliers account for cash and excess reserve leakages.</li>
            <li>Therefore, m<sub class="subscript">1</sub> and m<sub class="subscript">2</sub> are always smaller than 1/rr (except in the rare case where C and ER both = 0).</li>
            <li>ΔMS = m × ΔMB, where ΔMS = change in the money supply; m = the money multiplier; ΔMB = change in the monetary base. A positive sign means an increase in the MS; a negative sign means a decrease.</li>

            <li>Because M1 is part of M2, M2 is always &gt; M1 (except in the rare case where time deposits and money market funds = 0, in which case M1 = M2).</li>
            <li>That fact is reflected in the inclusion of the time deposit and money market fund ratios in the numerator of the M2 multiplier equation.</li>
            <li>Moreover, no reserves are required for time and money market funds, so they will have more multiple expansion than checkable deposits will.</li>
            <li>The required reserve ratio, the excess reserve ratio, and the currency ratio appear in the denominator of the m<sub class="subscript">1</sub> and M2 money multipliers because all three slow the multiple deposit creation process. The higher the reserve ratios (required and excess), the smaller the sum available to make loans from a given deposit. The more cash, the smaller the deposit.</li>
            <li>The currency, time deposit, and money market mutual fund ratios are in the numerator of the M2 money multiplier because M2 is composed of currency, checkable deposits, time deposits, and money market mutual funds.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch15_s03_p02"><em class="emphasis">As we saw at the beginning of this chapter, currency holdings, excess reserves, and required reserves slow down the multiple deposit creation process by removing funds from it</em>. The bigger rr and ER/D are, the less each bank lends of the new deposits it receives. <em class="emphasis">The bigger C/D is, the less money is deposited in the first place</em>. For those reasons, we place those variables in the denominator. The larger the denominator, holding the numerator constant, the smaller m<sub class="subscript">1</sub> or m<sub class="subscript">2</sub> will be, of course. <em class="emphasis">The appropriate money supply components compose the numerator-currency, and checkable deposits for m<sub class="subscript">1</sub>, and currency, checkable deposits, time deposits, and money market mutual funds compose the numerator for m<sub class="subscript">2</sub></em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch15_s03_p03">This leaves us to consider why C/D, rr, and ER/D change over time. <em class="emphasis">Short term, the currency ratio varies directly with the interest rate and the stability of the banking system</em>. As the interest rate increases, the opportunity cost of keeping cash increases, so people are less anxious to hold it. People are also less anxious to hold currency if the banking system is stable because their money is safer in a checking deposit. If interest rates are extremely low or people believe the banks might be shaky, they naturally want to hold more physical cash. <em class="emphasis">Longer term, C/D may be influenced by technology and loophole mining, encouraging bankers and depositors to eschew traditional checkable deposits in favor of sweep accounts</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch15_s03_p04">The required reserve ratio is mandated by the central bank but, as noted in <a class="xref" href="wright-ch10#wright-ch10">Chapter 10 "Innovation and Structure in Banking and Finance"</a>, loophole mining and technology have rendered it less important in recent years because sweep accounts allow banks to minimize the de jure level of their checkable deposits. <em class="emphasis">In many places, rr is no longer a binding constraint on banks so, as we’ll see, most central banks no longer consider changing it as an effective monetary policy tool</em>. (This in no way affects the money multiplier, which would provide the same figure for m<sub class="subscript">1</sub> or M2 whether we calculate them as above or replace rr and ER/D with R/D, where R = total reserves.)</p>

That means that rr must equal .2(100/500).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch15_s03_p08"><em class="emphasis">Excess reserves (or just reserves in a system without required reserves) are inversely related to the interest rate</em>. In the early 1960s and early 2000s, when the interest rate was well less than 5 percent, ER/D was high, at .003 to .004. In the 1970s and 1980s, when interest rates were 10 percent and higher, ER/D dropped to .001 to .002. As we learned in <a class="xref" href="wright-ch09#wright-ch09">Chapter 9 "Bank Management"</a>, <em class="emphasis">expected deposit outflows directly affect excess reserve levels as banks stock up on reserves to meet the outflows</em>. When uncertainty is high or a banking crisis is in progress or appears imminent, bankers will increase ER to protect their banks.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch15_s03_p09">In summary, the central bank influences the money supply by controlling the monetary base and, to a far lesser extent, the required reserve ratio. Depositors, banks, and borrowers influence the money supply by influencing m<sub class="subscript">1</sub> and M2, specifically by determining the money multiplier, with depositors largely in control of C/D; depositors and banks interacting via deposit outflow expectations to determine E/R; and borrowers, depositors, banks, and the central bank interacting to determine interest rates and hence to some extent both C/D and E/R.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111010-150152-234936">A ubiquitous stereotype portrays financiers as evil, brilliant, or both. While instances of uberintelligent, unfathomly selfish financiers can be adduced, most people working in the financial services sector are normal folks and not unusually greedy or smart. To understand the financial system in all its glorious complexity, readers need to expunge stereotypes of financiers from their minds. One way to do that is to cultivate critiques of media portrayals of all things financial.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch02_s01_p01">Ever notice that movies and books tend to portray financiers as evil and powerful monsters, bent on destroying all that decent folks hold dear for the sake of a fast buck? In his best-selling 1987 novel <em class="emphasis">Bonfire of the Vanities</em>,<span class="footnote" id="wright-fnXX_028"><a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Bonfire-Vanities-Tom-Wolfe/dp/0553275976">www.amazon.com/Bonfire-Vanities-Tom-Wolfe/dp/0553275976</a></span> for example, Tom Wolfe depicts Wall Street bond trader Sherman McCoy (played by Tom Hanks in the movie version)<span class="footnote" id="wright-fnXX_029"><a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099165">www.imdb.com/title/tt0099165</a></span> as a slimy “Master of the Universe”: rich, powerful, and a complete butthead. Who could forget Danny DeVito<span class="footnote" id="wright-ch02_fn99"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000362">www.imdb.com/name/nm0000362</a></span> as the arrogant, donut-scarfing “Larry the Liquidator” juxtaposed against the adorable, old factory owner Andrew Jorgenson (played by Gregory Peck)<span class="footnote" id="wright-ch02_fn98"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000060">www.imdb.com/name/nm0000060</a></span> in <em class="emphasis">Other People’s Money</em>?<span class="footnote" id="wright-fnXX_030"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102609">www.imdb.com/title/tt0102609</a></span> And moviegoers have now been treated to two flicks called <em class="emphasis">Wall Street</em>,<span class="footnote" id="wright-ch02_fn97">1987: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291">www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291</a>; 2010: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027718">www.imdb.com/title/tt1027718</a></span> which revile the nation’s largest and most important financiers and financial firms under thinly disguised names and circumstances.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111010-151704-915986">Bashing finance and financiers is not a passing fad; you may recall the unsavory Shylock character from Shakespeare’s play <em class="emphasis">The Merchant of Venice</em>.<span class="footnote" id="e19.wright-fnXX_019"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bibliomania.com/0/6/3/1050/frameset.html">www.bibliomania.com/0/6/3/1050/frameset.html</a></span> Even the Christmas classic <em class="emphasis">It’s a Wonderful Life</em><span class="footnote" id="e20.wright-fnXX_020"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nndb.com/films/309/000033210">www.nndb.com/films/309/000033210</a></span> contains at best a dual message. In the film, viewers learn that George Bailey, the lovable president of the local building and loan association (a type of community bank) played by Jimmy Stewart, saved Bedford Falls from the clutches of a character portrayed by Lionel Barrymore, actress Drew Barrymore’s grand-uncle, the ancient and evil financier Henry F. Potter. (No relation to Harry, I’m sure.) That’s hardly a ringing endorsement of finance.<span class="footnote" id="e21.wright-fnXX_021"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4820768732160163488">video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4820768732160163488</a></span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch02_s01_p02">Truth be told, some financiers have done bad things. Then again, so have members of every occupational, geographical, racial, religious, and ethnic group on the planet. <em class="emphasis">But most people, most of the time, are pretty decent, so we should not malign entire groups for the misdeeds of a few, especially when the group as a whole benefits others</em>. Financiers and the financial systems they inhabit benefit many people. The financial system does so much good for the economy, in fact, that some people believe that financiers are brilliant rocket scientists or at least “the smartest guys in the room.”<span class="footnote" id="wright-fnXX_027"><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smartest_Guys_in_the_Room">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smartest_Guys_in_the_Room</a></span> This positive stereotype, however, is as flawed as the negative one. While some investment bankers, insurance actuaries, and other fancy financiers could have worked for NASA, they are far from infallible. The financial crisis that began in 2007 reminds us, once again, that complex mathematical formulas are less useful in economics (and other social sciences) than in astrophysics. <em class="emphasis">Financiers, like politicians, religious leaders, and, yes, college professors, have made colossal mistakes in the past and will undoubtedly do so again in the future</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch02_s01_p03">So rather than lean on stereotypes, this chapter will help you to form your own view of the financial system. In the process, it will review the entire system. <em class="emphasis">It’s well worth your time and effort to read this chapter carefully because it contains a lot of descriptive information and definitions that will help you later in the text, as well as later in life.</em></p>

            <li>While some financiers are brilliant, they are not infallible, and fancy math does not reality make.</li>

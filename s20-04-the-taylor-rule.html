    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch17_s04_p12">Notice that as actual inflation exceeds the target, the Taylor Rule suggests raising the fed funds rate (tightening monetary policy). Notice too that as output falls relative to its potential, the rule suggests decreasing the fed funds rate (easier monetary policy). As output exceeds its potential, however, the rule suggests putting on the brakes by raising rates. Finally, if inflation and output are both screaming, the rule requires that the fed funds target soar quite high indeed, as it did in the early 1980s. In short, <em class="emphasis">the Taylor Rule is countercyclical and accounts for two important Federal Reserve goals: price stability and employment/output</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch17_s04_p13"><em class="emphasis">The Taylor Rule nicely explains U.S. macroeconomic history since 1960.</em> In the early 1960s, the two were matched: inflation was low, and growth was strong. In the latter part of the 1960s, the 1970s, and the early 1980s, actual ff* was generally well below what the Taylor Rule said it should be. In that period, inflation was so high we refer to the period as the Great Inflation. In the latter part of the 1980s, ff* was higher than what the Taylor Rule suggested. That was a period of weak growth but decreasing inflation. From 1990 or so until the early 2000s, a period of low inflation and high growth, the Taylor Rule and ff* were very closely matched. In the middle years of the first decade of the new millennium, however, the Fed kept ff* well below the Rule and thereby fueled the housing bubble that led to the 2007–8 crisis. Since then, the economy has been weak and little wonder: the Fed lowered rates to zero, but that was still well above the negative 7 percent or so called for by the rule. <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch17_s04_f03">Figure 17.2 "The Fed’s feds fund target and the Taylor Rule since 1987"</a> graphs the latter portion of the story.</p>

Both were at play but were moderating by the end of 2006, freezing the funds target at 5.25 percent, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch17_s04_f02">Figure 17.4 "Inflation and per capita gross domestic product (GDP), 2003–2006"</a>.

        <p class="para" id="wright-ch17_s04_p17">Foreign exchange rates can also flummox central bankers and their policies. Specifically, increasing (decreasing) interest rates will, ceteris paribus, cause a currency to appreciate (depreciate) in world currency markets. Why is that important?</p>
        <p class="para" id="wright-ch17_s04_p18">The value of a currency directly affects foreign trade. When a currency is strong relative to other currencies (when each unit of it can purchase many units of foreign currencies), imports will be stimulated because foreign goods will be cheap. Exports will be hurt, however, because domestic goods will look expensive to foreigners, who will have to give up many units of their local currency. Countries with economies heavily dependent on foreign trade must be extremely careful about the value of their currencies; almost every country is becoming more dependent on foreign trade, making exchange rate policy an increasingly important one for central banks worldwide to consider.</p>

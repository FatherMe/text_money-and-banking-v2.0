The phenomenon is so rare and minor that it need not detain us here.</span><em class="emphasis">worth more than money tomorrow</em>. If you don’t believe me, send me all of your money immediately. I’ll return every cent of it—scout’s honor—in exactly one year. I won’t hold my breath. You’d be foolish indeed to forgo food, clothes, housing, transportation, and entertainment for a year for no remuneration whatsoever. That’s why a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. (Another reason that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow is that, in modern economies based on fiat money, prices tend to rise every year. So $100 tomorrow will buy fewer goods and services than $100 today will. We will discuss the impact of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inflation</a><span class="glossdef">A sustained increase in the price level or average prices.</span></span> on interest rates more at the end of this chapter. For now, we consider only <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nominal interest rates</a><span class="glossdef">The price of borrowing money as it is usually stated, unadjusted for inflation.</span></span>, not the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real interest rate</a><span class="glossdef">The price of borrowing money adjusted for inflation.</span></span>.) But what if I told you that if you gave me $100 today, I’d give you $1,000 in a year? Most lenders would jump at that offer (provided they thought I would pay as promised and not default), but I wouldn’t offer it and neither would most borrowers. In fact, about $110 would be the most I’d be willing to give you in a year for $100 today. That’s an interest rate of 10 percent ($10/$100 = .1 or 10%), which, as comedian Adam Sandler might say, is “not too shabby.”<span class="footnote" id="wright-fnXX_067"><a class="link" href="http://www.tsrocks.com/a/adam_sandler_texts/the_chanukah_song.html">www.tsrocks.com/a/adam_sandler_texts/the_chanukah_song.html</a></span> If we let the loan ride, as they say, capitalizing the interest or, in other words, paying interest on the interest every year, called annually <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compounding</a><span class="glossdef">Earning interest on interest.</span></span> interest, your $100 investment would grow in value, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch04_s02_f01">Figure 4.1 "The fate of $100 invested at 10%, compounded annually"</a>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p02">The figures in the table are easily calculated by multiplying the previous year’s value by 1.10, 1 representing the principal value and .10 representing the interest rate <em class="emphasis">expressed as a decimal</em>. So $100 today (year = 0) is, at 10 percent interest compounded annually, worth $110 in a year (100 × 1.1), $121 after two years (110 × 1.1), $131.10 after three years (121 × 1.1), and so forth. The quick way to calculate this for any year is to use the following formula:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p03">FV = PV(1 + i)<sup class="superscript">n</sup></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p17">where</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p04">FV = the future value (the value of your investment in the future)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p05">PV = the present value (the amount of your investment today)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p06">(1 + i)<sup class="superscript">n</sup> = the future value factor (aka the present value factor or discount factor in the equation below)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p07"><em class="emphasis">i</em> = interest rate (decimalized, for example, 6% = .06; 25% = .25, 2.763% = .02763, etc.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p08"><em class="emphasis">n</em> = number of terms (here, years; elsewhere days, months, quarters)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p09">For $100 borrowed today at 10 percent compounded annually, in 100 years I’d owe you $1,378,061 (FV = 100 × 1.1<sup class="superscript">100</sup>). (Good luck collecting that one!)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p10">What if someone offers to pay you, say, $1,000 in 5 years? How much would you be willing to pay today for that? Clearly, something less than $1,000. Instead of taking a PV and expanding it via multiplication to determine an FV, here you must do the opposite, or in other words, reduce or “discount” an FV to a PV. You do so by dividing, as in the following formula:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p11">Obviously, we can’t solve this equation unless one of the two remaining variables is given. If the interest rate is given as 5 percent, you would pay $783.53 today for $1,000 payable in 5 years (PV = 1000/1.05<sup class="superscript">5</sup>). If it is 20 percent, you’d give only $401.88 (PV = 1000/1.2<sup class="superscript">5</sup>). If it is 1 percent, you would give $951.47 (PV = 1000/1.01<sup class="superscript">5</sup>). <em class="emphasis">Notice that as the interest rate rises (falls), the present value (price) of the future payment falls (rises). In other words, the price (PV) of some future payment (some FV; generically, a bond) and the rate of interest are inversely related</em>. You can see this algebraically by noting that the <em class="emphasis">i</em> term is in the denominator, so as it gets larger, PV must get smaller (holding FV constant, of course). Economically this makes sense because a higher interest rate means a higher opportunity cost for money, so a sum payable in the future is worth less the more dear money is (the more it costs to borrow it).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p12">If payment of the bond described just above were to be made in ten years instead of five, at 1 percent interest per year, you’d pay $905.29 (PV = 1000/1.01<sup class="superscript">10</sup>). Note here that, holding the interest rate (and all other factors) constant, you give less today for a payment further in the future ($905.29 &lt; $951.47). That too makes good sense because you’re without your money longer and need to be compensated for it by paying a lower price for the bond/promise/IOU today.</p>

        <p class="para" id="wright-ch04_s02_p14">No; 5 × 20 = 100, but the money payable next year and in subsequent years is not worth $5 million today if interest rates are above 0, and they almost always are.

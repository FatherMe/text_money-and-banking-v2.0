    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch23_s01_p01">The IS-LM model isn’t entirely agreeable to policymakers because it examines only the short term, and when pressed into service for the long-term, or changes in the price level, it suggests that policy initiatives are more likely to mess matters up than to improve them. In response, economists developed a new theory, aggregate demand and supply, that relates the price level to the total final goods and services demanded (aggregate demand [AD]) and the total supplied (aggregate supply [AS]). <em class="emphasis">This new framework is attractive for several reasons: (1) it can be used to examine both the short and the long run; (2) it takes a form similar to the microeconomic price theory model of supply and demand, so it is familiar; and (3) it gives policymakers some grounds for implementing activist economic policies</em>. To understand aggregate demand and supply theory, we need to understand how each of the curves is derived.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch23_s01_p02"><em class="emphasis">The aggregate demand curve can be derived three ways, through the IS-LM model</em><em class="emphasis">, with help from the quantity theory of money, or directly from its components</em>. Remember that Y = C + I + G + NX. As the price level falls, ceteris paribus, real money balances are higher. That spells a lower interest rate. A lower interest rate, in turn, means an increase in I (and hence Y). A lower interest rate also means a lower exchange rate and hence more exports and fewer imports. So NX also increases. (C might be positively affected by lower <em class="emphasis">i</em> as well.) As the price level increases, the opposite occurs. So the AD curve slopes downward.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch23_s01_p09">If M = $100 billion and V = 3, then PY must be $300 billion. If we set P, the price level, equal to 1, Y must equal $300 billion (300/1). If P is 2, then Y is $150 billion (300/2). If it is .5, then Y is $600 billion (300/.5). Plot those points and you get a downward sloping curve, as in <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch23_s01_f01">Figure 23.1 "Aggregate demand curve"</a>. The AD curve shifts right if the MS increases and left if it decreases. Continuing the example above, if we hold P constant at 1.0 but double M to $200 billion, then Y will double to $600 billion (200 × 3). (Recall that the theory suggests that V changes only slowly.) Cut M in half ($50 billion) and Y will fall by half, to $150 billion (50 × 3).</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wright-ch23_s01_l02">
            <li>The aggregate demand (AD) curve is the total quantity of final goods and services demanded at different price levels.</li>
            <li>It slopes downward because a lower price level, holding MS constant, means higher real money balances.</li>
            <li>Higher real money balances, in turn, mean lower interest rates, which means more investment (I) due to more +NPV projects and more net exports (NX) due to a weaker domestic currency (exports increase and imports decrease).</li>
            <li>The AD curve is positively related to changes in MS, C, I, G, and NX, and is negatively related to T.</li>
            <li>Those variables shift AD for the same reasons they shift Y<sub class="subscript">ad</sub> and the IS curve because all of them except taxes add to output.</li>
            <li>An increase in the MS increases AD (shifts the AD curve to the right) through the quantity theory of money and the equation of exchange MV = PY. Holding velocity and the price level constant, it is clear that increases in M must lead to increases in Y.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111010-162921-684023">Financial instruments come in three major varieties—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">debt</a><span class="glossdef">A financial instrument in which a type of maker called a borrower promises to pay a fixed sum on a fixed date to a holder called a lender (or bondholder).</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">equity</a><span class="glossdef">A financial instrument in which a type of maker called an issuer promises to pay a portion of its profits to a holder called an owner (or stockholder or shareholder).</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hybrid</a><span class="glossdef">A financial instrument that has some of the characteristics of debt and some of the characteristics of equity.</span></span>. Debt instruments, such as bonds, indicate a lender–borrower relationship in which the borrower promises to pay a fixed sum and interest to the lender at a specific date or over some period of time. Equity instruments, such as stocks, represent an ownership stake in which the holder of the instrument receives some portion of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">issuer</a><span class="glossdef">The maker or initial seller of a financial instrument.</span></span>’s profits. Hybrid instruments, such as preferred stock, have some of the characteristics of both debt and equity instruments. Like a bond, preferred stock instruments promise fixed payments on specific dates but, like a common stock, only if the issuer’s profits warrant. Convertible bonds, by contrast, are hybrid instruments because they provide holders with the option of converting debt instruments into equities.</p>

        <p class="para">How would you characterize financial instruments in the following forms?</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wright_1.1-ch01_s99_l99">
            <li>I, Joe Schmo, promise to pay to Jane Doe at her home on Mockingbird Lane $100 at the end of the fiscal quarter.</li>
            <li>I, Joe Schmo, promise to pay to Jane Doe at her home on Mockingbird Lane 10 percent of all profits arising from my taco stand at the end of each fiscal quarter.</li>
            <li>I, Joe Schmo, promise to pay to Jane Doe at her home on Mockingbird Lane $100 at the end of each fiscal quarter if my taco stand earns at least that much profit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">The first instrument is a debt because Joe promises to pay Jane a fixed sum on a certain date. Joe is a simple borrower and Jane, his creditor/lender. The second instrument is an equity because Joe promises to pay Jane a percentage of profit, making Jane a part owner of the business. The third instrument is a hybrid because Joe promises to pay Jane a fixed sum but only if his taco stand is profitable. Parallel to the first instrument, Jane will receive a fixed sum on a fixed date (as in a loan), but like the second instrument, payment of the sum is contingent on the taco stand’s profits (as in an ownership stake).</p>

            <li>Financial instruments, or securities, are contracts that specify who pays whom as well as how, if, when, and where payment is due.</li>
            <li>Debt instruments are for fixed sums on fixed dates and need to be paid in all events.</li>
            <li>Equities are ownership stakes that entitle owners to a portion of profits.</li>
            <li>Hybrid instruments are part debt and part equity or are convertible from one into the other.</li>

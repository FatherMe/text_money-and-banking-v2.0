    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s01_p01">Some regulations are clearly salubrious and should be retained. The main justifications for financial system regulation—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market failures</a><span class="glossdef">The inefficient allocation of resources by a free market caused by asymmetric information, externalities (costs or benefits not reflected in market prices), natural monopolies or other forms of excessive market power,  and public goods (goods like national defense that cannot be profitably supplied by non-government entities due to free-rider problems).</span></span>—do occur, and government regulations can, and sometimes have, helped to mitigate them. Like everything else in life, however, regulations are costly (not gratis) and hence entail trade-offs. As detailed in another chapter, they induce perfectly legal but bureaucratically disruptive <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">loophole mining</a><span class="glossdef">The search for ways around regulations.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lobbying</a><span class="glossdef">Attempts to change regulations.</span></span> activities. They can also lead to severely twisted, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">unintended consequences</a><span class="glossdef">Events (usually negative) caused by regulations that lawmakers did not foresee.</span></span>, like banks purposely making bad loans.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-102827-548553">The goal of this chapter is not to bash all regulation but rather to critique specific financial regulations in the hopes of creating better regulatory policies in the (hopefully near) future. The place to start, I believe, is to think about what regulators and regulations cannot do, and that is fix the world by decree. <em class="emphasis">Simply making an activity illegal does not mean that it will stop</em>. Because the government faces a budget constraint and opportunity costs, it can’t afford to monitor everyone all the time. What’s bad for some is often good for others, so many people willingly supply illegal goods or activities. As a result, many illegal activities are commonplace; in no particular order, sodomy, drug use, reckless use of automobiles, and music piracy come to mind. This may seem like a simple point, but many people believe that regulation can really work if only regulations, and the regulators charged with enforcing them, are strengthened. If regulations failed in the past, they believe that means regulators needed more money or authority, or both.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s01_p02"><em class="emphasis">The problem with this view, however, is that government officials may not be the angels many people assume they are</em>. It’s not their fault. Especially if they went through the U.S. public school system, they likely learned an interpretation of government called the public interest model. As its name suggests, <em class="emphasis">the</em> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public interest model</a><span class="glossdef">A model of government developed by political scientists that posits that politicians, bureaucrats, and other government workers serve the public in lieu of themselves.</span></span> <em class="emphasis">posits that government officials work in the interests of the public, of “the people,” if you will</em>. It’s the sort of thing Abraham Lincoln had in mind in his famous Gettysburg Address when he said “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-103932-327584"><a class="link" href="http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm">showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm</a></span> That’s outstanding political rhetoric, better than anything current spin artists concoct, but is it a fair representation of reality?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s01_p03">Many economists think not. They believe that private interest prevails, even in the government. <em class="emphasis">According to their model, called the</em> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public choice</a><span class="glossdef"><em class="emphasis">See</em> private interest model.</span></span> <em class="emphasis">or, less confusingly, the</em> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">private interest model</a><span class="glossdef">A model of government developed by economists that posits that politicians, bureaucrats, and other government workers serve themselves in lieu of the citizens or public.</span></span><em class="emphasis">, politicians and bureaucrats often behave in their own interests rather than those of the public</em>. Of course, they don’t go around saying that we need law X or regulation Y to help me to get rich via bribes, to bailout my brother-in-law, or to ensure that I soon receive a cushy job in the private sector. Rather, they say that we need law X or regulation Y to protect widows and orphans, to stymie the efforts of bad guys, or to make the rich pay for their success.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s01_p04"><em class="emphasis">In many countries, the ones we will call “predatory” in the context of the Growth Diamond model</em><em class="emphasis">, the private interest model clearly holds sway</em>. In rich countries, the public interest model becomes more plausible. Nevertheless, many economic regulations, though clothed in public interest rhetoric, appear on close inspection to conform to the private interest model. As University of Chicago economist and Nobel Laureate George Stigler<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-104011-786214"><a class="link" href="http://www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/Enc/bios/Stigler.html">www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/Enc/bios/Stigler.html</a></span> pointed out decades ago, regulators are often “captured”<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-104011-786281"><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture</a></span> by the industry they regulate. <em class="emphasis">In other words, the industry establishes regulations for itself by influencing the decisions of regulators</em>. Financial regulators, as we’ll see, are no exception.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s01_p05">Regardless of regulators’ and politicians’ motivations, another very sticky question arises: <em class="emphasis">could regulators stop bad activities, events, and people even if they wanted to? The answer in many contexts appears to be an unequivocal “No!</em>” The reason is our old nemesis, asymmetric information, which, readers should recall, inheres in nature and pervades all. It flummoxes governments as much as markets and intermediaries. The implications of this insight are devastating for the effectiveness of regulators and their regulations, as <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch11_s01_f01">Figure 11.1 "Asymmetric information and regulation"</a> makes clear.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s01_p07"><em class="emphasis">And if you really want to get your head spinning, consider this: agency problems within the government, within regulatory bureaucracies, and within banks abound</em>. Within banks, traders and loan officers want to keep their jobs, earn promotions, and bring home large bonuses. They can do the latter two by taking large risks, and sometimes they choose to do so. Sometimes shareholders want to take on much larger risks than managers or depositors or other debt holders do. Sometimes it’s the managers who have incentives to place big bets, to get their stock options “in the money.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-wright-fn11_004"><a class="link" href="http://www.investorwords.com/2580/in_the_money.html">www.investorwords.com/2580/in_the_money.html</a></span> Within bureaucracies, regulators have incentives to hide their mistakes and to take credit for good outcomes, even if they had little or nothing to do with them. The same is true for the government, where the legislature may try to discredit the executive’s policies, or vice versa, and withhold information or even spread disinformation to “prove” its case.</p>

        <p class="para" id="wright-ch11_s01_p08">In the 1910s and early 1920s, a majority of U.S. states passed securities regulations called Blue Sky Laws that ostensibly sought to prevent slimy securities dealers from selling nothing but the blue sky to poor, defenseless widows and orphans. Can you figure out what was really going on? (<em class="emphasis">Hint</em>: Recall that this was a period of traditional banking, unit banks, the 3-6-3 rule, and all that. Recall, too, that securities markets are an alternative method of linking investors to borrowers.)</p>
        <p class="para" id="wright-ch11_s01_p09">We probably gave it away with that last hint. Blue Sky Laws, scholars now realize, were veiled attempts to protect the monopolies of unit bankers upset about losing business to the securities markets. Unable to garner public sympathy for their plight, the bankers instead spoke in terms of public interest, of defrauded widows and orphans. There were certainly some scams about, but not enough to warrant the more virulent Blue Sky Laws, which actually gave state officials the power to forbid issuance of securities they didn’t like, and in some states, that was most of them!</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="wright-ch11_s01_l02">
            <li>The government can’t legislate bad things away because it can’t be every place at once. Like the rest of us, government faces budget constraints and opportunity costs. Therefore, it cannot stop activities that some people enjoy or find profitable.</li>
            <li>According to the public interest model, government tries to enact laws, regulations, and policies that benefit the public.</li>
            <li>The private interest (or public choice) model, by contrast, suggests that government officials enact laws that are in their own private interest.</li>
            <li>It is important to know which model is a more accurate description of reality because the models have very different implications for our attitudes toward regulation.</li>
            <li>If one believes the public interest model is usually correct, then one will be more likely to call for government regulation, even if one admits that regulatory goals may in fact be difficult to achieve regardless of the intentions of politicians and bureaucrats.</li>
            <li>If one believes the private interest model is a more accurate depiction of the real world, one will be more skeptical of government regulation.</li>
            <li>Asymmetric information creates a principal-agent problem between the public and elected officials, another principal-agent problem between those officials and regulators, and yet another principal-agent problem between regulators and banks (and other financial firms) because in each case, one party (politicians, regulators, banks) knows more than the other (public, politicians, regulators).</li>
            <li>So there are at least three places where the public’s interest can be stymied: in political elections, in the interaction between Congress and the president and regulatory agencies, and in the interaction between regulators and the regulated. And that’s ignoring the often extensive agency problems found <em class="emphasis">within</em> governments, regulatory agencies, and financial institutions!</li>

<span class="title-prefix">11.2</span> The Great Depression as Regulatory Failure</h2>

            <li>How did the government exacerbate the Great Depression?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Time again, government regulators have either failed to stop financial crises or have exacerbated them</em>. Examples are too numerous to discuss in detail here, so we will address only two of the more egregious cases, the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Savings and Loan (S&amp;L) Crisis of the 1980s.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s02_p02">Generally when economic matters go FUBAR (<strong class="emphasis bold">F</strong>ouled <strong class="emphasis bold">U</strong>p <strong class="emphasis bold">B</strong>eyond <strong class="emphasis bold">A</strong>ll <strong class="emphasis bold">R</strong>ecognition in polite circles), observers blame either “market failures” like asymmetric information and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">externalities</a><span class="glossdef">Costs or benefits of an economic activity that are not included in the price, that are not internalized by the buyer and/or seller. Negative externalities, like pollution, impose costs on society; positive externalities, like education, provide societal benefits.</span></span>, or they blame the government. Reality is rarely that simple. <em class="emphasis">Most major economic foul-ups stem from a combination of market and government failures, what I like to call hybrid failures</em>. So while it would be an exaggeration to claim that government policies were the only causes of the Great Depression or the Savings and Loan Crisis, it is fair to say that they made matters worse, much worse.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s02_p03">The stock market crash of 1929 did not start the Great Depression, but it did give the economy a strong push downhill.<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-104658-421255"><a class="link" href="http://stocks.fundamentalfinance.com/stock-market-crash-of-1929.php">stocks.fundamentalfinance.com/stock-market-crash-of-1929.php</a></span> A precipitous decline in stock prices like that of 1929 can cause uncertainty to increase and balance sheets to deteriorate, worsening asymmetric information problems and leading to a decline in economic activity. That, in turn, can cause bank panics, further increases in asymmetric information, and yet further declines in economic activity followed by an unanticipated decline in the price level. <em class="emphasis">As</em> <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch11_s02_f01">Figure 11.2 "Major macro variables during the Great Depression"</a> <em class="emphasis"> shows, that is precisely what happened during the Great Depression—per capita gross domestic product (GDP) shrank, the number of bankruptcies soared, M1 and M2 (measures of the money supply) declined, and so did the price level</em>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s02_p04">Weren’t evil financiers completely responsible for this mess, as nine out of ten people thought at the time? Absolutely not. For starters, very few financiers benefited from the depression and they did not have the ability to cause such a mess. Most would have stopped the downward spiral if it was in their power to do so, as J. P. Morgan did when panic seized the financial system in 1907.<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-105019-315574"><a class="link" href="http://www.bos.frb.org/about/pubs/panicof1.pdf">www.bos.frb.org/about/pubs/panicof1.pdf</a></span> In fact, only the government had the resources and institutions to stop the Great Depression and it failed to do so. <em class="emphasis">Mistake number one occurred during the 1920s, when the government allowed stock and real estate prices to rise to dizzying heights</em>. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average started the decade at 108.76, dropped to around 60, then began a slow climb to 200 by the end of 1927. It hit 300 by the end of 1928 and 350 by August 1929.)<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-105019-315631"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://measuringworth.com/datasets/DJA">measuringworth.com/datasets/DJA</a></span> By slowly raising interest rates beginning in, say, mid-1928, the Federal Reserve (Fed) could have deflated the stock market <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bubble</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when the price of an asset rises significantly above its rational range, with its price based on fundamentals like interest rates, profitability, and so forth.</span></span> before it grew to enormous proportions and burst in 1929.</p>

In addition, the Federal Reserve did not behave like a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lender of last resort (LLR)</a><span class="glossdef">A clearinghouse, central bank, or government that lends during crises, usually by following some variant of Bagehot’s Rule/Hamilton’s Rule.</span></span> during the crisis and follow <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Bagehot’s/Hamilton’s Rule</a><span class="glossdef">A policy, described first by Alexander Hamilton and later by Walter Bagehot, in which, during a crisis, a lender of last resort lends freely at a penalty rate to all borrowers who can post sufficient collateral.</span></span>.

They were, accordingly, unprepared to thwart major bank runs.<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-105938-908025">Michael Bordo and David Wheelock, “The Promise and Performance of the Federal Reserve as Lender of Last Resort,” Norges Bank Working Paper 201 (20 January 2011). <a class="link" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1847472">papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1847472</a></span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-105429-533635">The government’s third mistake was its banking policy. <em class="emphasis">T</em><em class="emphasis">he United States was home to tens of thousands of tiny unit banks that simply were not large or diversified enough to ride out the depression</em>. If a factory or other major employer succumbed, the local bank too was doomed. Depositors understood this, so at the first sign of trouble they ran on their banks, pulling out their deposits before they went under. Their actions guaranteed that their banks would indeed fail. Meanwhile, across the border in Canada, which was home to a few large and highly diversified banks, few bank disturbances took place. California also weathered the Great Depression relatively well, in part because its banks, which freely branched throughout the large state, enjoyed relatively well-diversified assets and hence avoided the worst of the bank crises.</p>

FDR’s creation of a deposit insurance scheme under the aegis of a new federal agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), did restore confidence, inducing people to stop running on the banks and thereby stopping the economy’s death spiral</em>. Since then, bank runs have been rare occurrences directed at specific shaky banks and not system-wide disturbances as during the Great Depression and earlier banking crises.</p>

In fact, the latest research suggests it is a wash</em>. Deposit insurance does prevent bank runs because depositors know the insurance fund will repay them if their bank goes belly up. (Today, it insures $250,000 per depositor per insured bank. For details, browse<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insured/basics.html"> http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insured/basics.html</a>) However, insurance also reduces depositor monitoring, which allows bankers to take on added risk. In the nineteenth century, depositors disciplined banks that took on too much risk by withdrawing their deposits. As we’ve seen, that decreases the size of the bank and reduces reserves, forcing bankers to decrease their risk profile. With deposit insurance, depositors (quite rationally) blithely ignore the adverse selection problem and shift their funds to wherever they will fetch the most interest. They don’t ask how Shaky Bank is able to pay 15 percent for six-month certificates of deposit (CDs) when other banks pay only 5 percent. Who cares, they reason, my deposits are insured! Indeed, but as we’ll learn below, taxpayers insure the insurer.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s02_p09"><em class="emphasis">Another New Deal financial reform, Glass-Steagall, in no way helped the U.S. economy or financial system and may have hurt both</em>. For over half a century, Glass-Steagall prevented U.S. banks from simultaneously engaging in commercial (taking deposits and making loans) and investment banking (underwriting securities and advising on mergers) activities. Only two groups clearly gained from the legislation, politicians who could thump their chests on the campaign stump and claim to have saved the country from greedy financiers and, ironically enough, big investment banks. The latter, it turns out, wrote the act and did so in such a way that it protected their oligopoly from the competition of commercial banks and smaller, more retail-oriented investment banks. The act was clearly unnecessary from an economic standpoint because most countries had no such legislation and suffered no ill effects because of its absence. (The Dodd-Frank Act’s Volcker Rule represents a better approach because it outlaws various dubious <em class="emphasis">practices</em>, like proprietary trading, not valid organizational <em class="emphasis">forms</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s02_p10"><em class="emphasis">The Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) genesis is almost as tawdry and its record almost as bad</em>. The SEC’s stated goal, to increase the transparency of America’s financial markets, was a laudable one. Unfortunately, the SEC simply does not do its job very well. As the late, great, free-market proponent Milton Friedman put it:</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s04_p01">The S&amp;L crisis and the failure of a few big commercial banks induced a series of regulatory reforms in the United States. The first such act, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), became law in August 1989. That act canned the old S&amp;L regulators, created new regulatory agencies, and bailed out the bankrupt insurance fund. In the end, U.S. taxpayers reimbursed depositors at the failed S&amp;Ls. FIRREA also re-regulated S&amp;Ls, increasing their capital requirements and imposing the same risk-based capital standards that commercial banks are subject to. Since passage of the act, many S&amp;Ls have converted to commercial banks and few new S&amp;Ls have been formed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s04_p02"><em class="emphasis">In 1991, the government enacted further reforms in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA)</em>, which continued the bailout of the S&amp;Ls and the deposit insurance fund, raised deposit insurance premiums, and forced the FDIC to close failed banks using the least costly method. (Failed banks can be dismembered and their pieces sold off one by one. That often entails selling assets at a discount. Or an entire bank can be sold to a healthy bank, which, of course, wants a little sugar [read, “cash”] to induce it to embrace a zombie!) The act also forced the FDIC to charge risk-based insurance premiums instead of a flat fee. The system it developed, however, resulted in 90 percent of banks, accounting for 95 percent of all deposits, paying the same premium. The original idea of taxing risky banks and rewarding safe ones was therefore subverted.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s04_p03"><em class="emphasis">FDICIA’s crowning glory is that it requires regulators to intervene earlier and more stridently when banks first get into trouble, well before losses eat away their capital</em>. The idea is to close banks before they go broke, and certainly before they arise from the dead.

While that sounds reassuring and noble, the policy increases moral hazard, encouraging large financial institutions to take on large risks.</span></span>. Regulators cooked up TBTF during the 1980s to justify bailing out a big shaky bank called Continental Illinois. Like deposit insurance, TBTF was ostensibly a noble notion. If a really big bank failed and owed large sums to lots of other banks and nonbank financial institutions, it could cause a domino effect that could topple numerous companies very quickly. That, in turn, would cause asymmetric information and uncertainty to rise, risk premia on bonds to jump, stock prices to fall…you get the picture.<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-111524-915193">If not, read an article that influenced policymakers: Ben Bernanke, “Nonmonetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression,” <em class="emphasis">American Economic Review</em> 73 (June 1983): 257–76.</span><em class="emphasis">The problem is that if a bank thinks it is too big to be allowed to fail, it has an incentive to take on a lot of risk, confident that the government will have its back if it gets into trouble</em>. (Banks in this respect are little different from drunken frat boys, or so I’ve heard.) Financier Henry Kaufman has termed this problem the Bigness Dilemma<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-111524-915249">The dilemma is that big banks in other regards are stabilizing rather than destabilizing because they have clearly achieved efficient scale and maintain a diversified portfolio of assets.</span> and long feared that it could lead to a catastrophic economic meltdown, a political crisis, or a major economic slump. His fears came to fruition during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, of which we will learn more in another chapter. Similarly some analysts believe that Japan’s TBTF policy was a leading cause of its recent fifteen-year economic funk. So like most other regulations, TBTF imposes costs that may exceed its benefits, depending on the details of how each are tallied. Such tallies, unfortunately, are often suffused with partisan ideological assumptions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s04_p05">In 1994, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act finally overturned most prohibitions on interstate banking. That law led to considerable consolidation, the effects of which are still unclear. Nevertheless, the act was long overdue, as was the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, which repealed Glass-Steagall, allowing the same institutions to engage in both commercial and investment banking activities. The act has led to some conglomeration, but not as much as many observers expected. Again, it may be some time before the overall effects of the reform become clear. So far, both acts appear to have strengthened the financial system by making banks more profitable and diversified. Some large complex banking organizations and large complex financial institutions (LCBOs and LCFIs, respectively) have held up well in the face of the subprime mortgage crisis, but others went bankrupt. The recent crisis appears to have been rooted in more fundamental issues, like TBTF and a dearth of internal incentive alignment within financial institutions, big and small, than in the regulatory reforms of the 1990s.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p01">Due to the prevalence of banking crises worldwide and the financial system’s increasingly global and integrated nature, international regulators, especially the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, have also been busy. Their recommendations are not binding on sovereign nations, but to date they have obtained significant buy-in worldwide. America’s financial reforms in the 1990s, for example, were influenced by the so-called Basel I recommendations of 1988. Almost all countries have complied, on paper anyway, with Basel I rules on minimum and risk-weighted capitalization. <em class="emphasis">Risk-weighting was indeed an improvement over the older capitalization requirements, which were simply a minimum leverage ratio</em>:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p04">Of course, leverage ratios are much too simplistic because a bank with a leverage ratio of only 4 percent but with a diversified portfolio of very safe loans would be much safer than one with a leverage ratio of 10 percent but whose assets were invested entirely in lottery tickets!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p05"><em class="emphasis">The concept of weighting risks is therefore a solid one</em>. A bank holding nothing but reserves would need very little capital compared to one holding mostly high-risk loans to biotech and nanotech startups. <em class="emphasis">Bankers, however, consider the Basel I weights too arbitrary and too broad</em>. For example, Basel I suggested weighting sovereign bonds at zero. That’s great for developed countries, but plenty of poorer nations regularly default on their bonds. Some types of assets received a weighting of .5, others 1, others 1.5, and so forth, as the asset grew riskier. So, for example, the following assets would be weighted according to their risk before being put into a leverage ratio:</p>

				<em class="emphasis">And so forth. But the weights were arbitrary. Are mortgages exactly half again as risky as commercial loans? Basel I basically encouraged banks to decrease their holdings of assets that the regulations overweighted and to stock up on assets that it underweighted. Not a pretty sight.</em>
			</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p07"><em class="emphasis">In response to such criticism, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced in June 2004 a new set of guidelines, called Basel II, initially slated for implementation in 2008 and 2009 in the G10 countries</em>. Basel II contains three pillars: capital, supervisory review process, and market discipline. According to the latest and greatest research, <em class="emphasis">Rethinking Bank Regulation</em> by James Barth, Gerard Caprio, and Ross Levine, the first two pillars are not very useful ways of regulating banks. The new risk weighting is an improvement, but it still grossly oversimplifies risk management and is not holistic enough. Moreover, supervisors cannot monitor every aspect of every bank all the time. Banks have to make periodic call reports on their balance sheets, income, and dividends but, like homeowners selling their homes, they pretty up the place before the prospective buyers arrive. In more developed countries, regulators also conduct surprise on-site examinations during which the examiners rate banks according to the so-called CAMELS formulation:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p08">C = capital adequacy</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p09">A = asset quality</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p10">M = management</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p11">E = earnings</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p12">L = liquidity (reserves)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p13">S = sensitivity to market risk.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p14">A, M, and S are even more difficult to ascertain than C, E, and L and, as noted above, any or all of the variables can change very rapidly. Moreover, <em class="emphasis">much banking activity these days takes place off the balance sheet, where it is even more difficult for regulators to find and accurately assess</em>. Finally, in many jurisdictions, examiners are incorrecty compensated and hence do not do a very thorough job.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p15">Barth, Caprio, and Levine argue that the third pillar of Basel II, financial market monitoring, is different. In aggregate, market participants can and in fact do monitor banks and bankers much more often and much more astutely than regulators can because they have much more at stake than a relatively low-paying job. <em class="emphasis">Barth, Caprio, and Levine argue persuasively that instead of conceiving of themselves as police officers, judges, and juries, bank regulators should see themselves as aides, as helping bank depositors (and other creditors of the bank) and stockholders to keep the bankers in line</em>. After all, nobody gains from a bank’s failure. The key, they believe, is to ensure that debt and equity holders have incentives and opportunities to monitor bank management to ensure that they are not taking on too much risk. That means reducing asymmetric information by ensuring reliable information disclosure and urging that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">corporate governance</a><span class="glossdef">Guidelines concerning how an incorporated business should be ruled, including the number of directors and the process by which they are selected.</span></span> best practices be followed.<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-112444-656464">Frederick D. Lipman, <em class="emphasis">Corporate Governance Best Practices: Strategies for Public, Private, and Not-for-Profit Organizations</em> (Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley, 2006).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch11_s05_p16"><em class="emphasis">Regulators can also provide banks with incentives to keep their asset bases sufficiently diversified and to prevent them from engaging in inappropriate activities, like building rocket ships or running water treatment plants</em>. Screening new banks and bankers, if regulators do it to reduce adverse selection (omit shysters or inexperienced people) rather than to aid existing banks (by blocking all or most new entrants and hence limiting competition) or to line their own pockets (via bribes), is another area where regulators can be effective. By focusing on a few key reachable goals, regulators can concentrate their limited resources and get the job done, the job of letting people look after their own property themselves. The market-based approach, scholars note, is most important in less-developed countries where regulators are more likely to be on the take (to enact and enforce regulations simply to augment their incomes via bribes).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-2247-20110201120008791299">U.S. implementation of Basel II was disrupted by the worst financial dislocation in 80 years. Intense lobbying pressure combined with the uncertainties created by the 2008 crisis led to numerous changes and implementation delays. As of writing (September 2011), the move to Basel II had barely begun in the United States, though full implementation of yet newer regulations, Basel III, are currently slated to take effect in 2019.<span class="footnote" id="wright_1.1-5066-20111108-113013-338688">Pierre-Hugues Verdier, “U.S. Implementation of Basel II: Lessons for Informal International Law-Making,” University of Virginia School of Law Working Paper (30 June 2011). <a class="link" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1879391">papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1879391</a></span></p>

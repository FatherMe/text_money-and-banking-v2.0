Without a job, you’ll be forced to move back home. Best to pay attention then!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s01_p02">Interest can be thought of as the payment it takes to induce a lender to part with his, her, or its money for some period of time, be it a day, week, month, year, decade, or century. To make comparisons between those payments easier, interest is almost always expressed as an annual percentage rate, the number of dollars (or other currency)<span class="footnote" id="wright-ch04_fn86"><a class="link" href="http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/currency_table.html">fx.sauder.ubc.ca/currency_table.html</a></span> paid for the use of $100 per year. <em class="emphasis">Several ways of measuring interest rates exist, but here you’ll learn only</em> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">yield to maturity (YTM)</a><span class="glossdef">The most economically accurate way of measuring interest rates.</span></span><em class="emphasis">, the method preferred by economists for its accuracy</em>.

            <li>Interest is the opportunity cost of lending money or the price of borrowing it and can be thought of as the payment a borrower needs to induce him, her, or it to lend.</li>
            <li>Interest is important because it helps to determine the price of assets, especially financial assets, and to determine various macroeconomic variables, including aggregate output.</li>

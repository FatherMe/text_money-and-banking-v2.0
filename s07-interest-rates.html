The phenomenon is so rare and minor that it need not detain us here.</span><em class="emphasis">worth more than money tomorrow</em>. If you don’t believe me, send me all of your money immediately. I’ll return every cent of it—scout’s honor—in exactly one year. I won’t hold my breath. You’d be foolish indeed to forgo food, clothes, housing, transportation, and entertainment for a year for no remuneration whatsoever. That’s why a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. (Another reason that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow is that, in modern economies based on fiat money, prices tend to rise every year. So $100 tomorrow will buy fewer goods and services than $100 today will. We will discuss the impact of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inflation</a><span class="glossdef">A sustained increase in the price level or average prices.</span></span> on interest rates more at the end of this chapter. For now, we consider only <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nominal interest rates</a><span class="glossdef">The price of borrowing money as it is usually stated, unadjusted for inflation.</span></span>, not the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real interest rate</a><span class="glossdef">The price of borrowing money adjusted for inflation.</span></span>.) But what if I told you that if you gave me $100 today, I’d give you $1,000 in a year? Most lenders would jump at that offer (provided they thought I would pay as promised and not default), but I wouldn’t offer it and neither would most borrowers. In fact, about $110 would be the most I’d be willing to give you in a year for $100 today. That’s an interest rate of 10 percent ($10/$100 = .1 or 10%), which, as comedian Adam Sandler might say, is “not too shabby.”<span class="footnote" id="wright-fnXX_067"><a class="link" href="http://www.tsrocks.com/a/adam_sandler_texts/the_chanukah_song.html">www.tsrocks.com/a/adam_sandler_texts/the_chanukah_song.html</a></span> If we let the loan ride, as they say, capitalizing the interest or, in other words, paying interest on the interest every year, called annually <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compounding</a><span class="glossdef">Earning interest on interest.</span></span> interest, your $100 investment would grow in value, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch04_s02_f01">Figure 4.1 "The fate of $100 invested at 10%, compounded annually"</a>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p02">The figures in the table are easily calculated by multiplying the previous year’s value by 1.10, 1 representing the principal value and .10 representing the interest rate <em class="emphasis">expressed as a decimal</em>. So $100 today (year = 0) is, at 10 percent interest compounded annually, worth $110 in a year (100 × 1.1), $121 after two years (110 × 1.1), $131.10 after three years (121 × 1.1), and so forth. The quick way to calculate this for any year is to use the following formula:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p17">where</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p05">PV = the present value (the amount of your investment today)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p06">(1 + i)<sup class="superscript">n</sup> = the future value factor (aka the present value factor or discount factor in the equation below)</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p09">For $100 borrowed today at 10 percent compounded annually, in 100 years I’d owe you $1,378,061 (FV = 100 × 1.1<sup class="superscript">100</sup>). (Good luck collecting that one!)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p10">What if someone offers to pay you, say, $1,000 in 5 years? How much would you be willing to pay today for that? Clearly, something less than $1,000. Instead of taking a PV and expanding it via multiplication to determine an FV, here you must do the opposite, or in other words, reduce or “discount” an FV to a PV. You do so by dividing, as in the following formula:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p11">Obviously, we can’t solve this equation unless one of the two remaining variables is given. If the interest rate is given as 5 percent, you would pay $783.53 today for $1,000 payable in 5 years (PV = 1000/1.05<sup class="superscript">5</sup>). If it is 20 percent, you’d give only $401.88 (PV = 1000/1.2<sup class="superscript">5</sup>). If it is 1 percent, you would give $951.47 (PV = 1000/1.01<sup class="superscript">5</sup>). <em class="emphasis">Notice that as the interest rate rises (falls), the present value (price) of the future payment falls (rises). In other words, the price (PV) of some future payment (some FV; generically, a bond) and the rate of interest are inversely related</em>. You can see this algebraically by noting that the <em class="emphasis">i</em> term is in the denominator, so as it gets larger, PV must get smaller (holding FV constant, of course). Economically this makes sense because a higher interest rate means a higher opportunity cost for money, so a sum payable in the future is worth less the more dear money is (the more it costs to borrow it).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s02_p12">If payment of the bond described just above were to be made in ten years instead of five, at 1 percent interest per year, you’d pay $905.29 (PV = 1000/1.01<sup class="superscript">10</sup>). Note here that, holding the interest rate (and all other factors) constant, you give less today for a payment further in the future ($905.29 &lt; $951.47). That too makes good sense because you’re without your money longer and need to be compensated for it by paying a lower price for the bond/promise/IOU today.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s03_p01">Interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the problems already presented in this chapter. Sometimes it compounds quarterly, monthly, daily, even continuously. The more frequent the compounding period, the more valuable the bond or other instrument, all else constant. The mathematics remains the same (though a little more difficult when compounding is continuous), but you must be careful about what you plug into the equation for <em class="emphasis">i</em> and n. For example, $1,000 invested at 12 percent for a year compounded annually would be worth $1,000 × (1.12)<sup class="superscript">1</sup> = $1,120.00. But that same sum invested for the same term at the same rate of interest but compounded <em class="emphasis">monthly</em> would grow to $1,000 × (1.01)<sup class="superscript">12</sup> = $1,126.83 because the interest paid each month is capitalized, earning interest at 12 percent. Note that we represent <em class="emphasis">i</em> as the interest paid <em class="emphasis">per period</em> (.12 interest/12 months in a year = .01) and <em class="emphasis">n</em> as the number of periods (12 in a year; 12 × 1 = 12), rather than the number of years. That same sum, and so forth with interest compounded quarterly (4 times a year) would grow to $1,000 × (1.03)<sup class="superscript">4</sup> = $1,125.51. The differences among annual, monthly, and quarterly compounding here are fairly trivial, amounting to less than $7 all told, but are important for bigger sums, higher interest rates, more frequent compounding periods, and longer terms. One million dollars at 4 percent for a year compounded annually comes to $1,000,000 × (1.04) = $1,040,000, while on the same terms compounded quarterly, it produces $1,000,000 × (1.01)<sup class="superscript">4</sup> = $1,040,604.01. (I’ll take the latter sum over the former any day and “invest” the surplus in a very nice dinner and concert tickets.) Likewise, $100 at 300 percent interest for 5 years compounded annually becomes 100 × (4)<sup class="superscript">5</sup> = $102,400. Compounded quarterly, that $100 grows to $100 × (1.75)<sup class="superscript">20</sup> = $7,257,064.34! A mere $1 at 6 percent compounded annually for 100 years will be worth $1 × (1.06)<sup class="superscript">100</sup> = $339.30. The same buck at the same interest compounded monthly swells in a century to $1 × (1.005)<sup class="superscript">1200</sup> = $397.44. <em class="emphasis">This all makes good sense because interest is being received sooner than the end of the year and hence is more valuable because, as we know, money now is better than money later</em>.</p>

Four major types of instruments that you are likely to encounter include discount bonds, simple loans, fixed-payment loans, and coupon bonds.</p>

Also known as a zero coupon bond.</span></span> (aka a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">zero coupon bond</a><span class="glossdef"><em class="emphasis">See</em> discount bond.</span></span> or simply a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">zero</a><span class="glossdef"><em class="emphasis">See</em> discount bond.</span></span>) makes only one payment, its face value on its maturity or redemption date, so its price is easily calculated using the present value formula. If the interest rate is 6 percent, the price of a discount bond with a $1,000 face value due in exactly a year would be $943.40 (1000/1.06). If the interest rate is 12 percent, the same discount bond’s price would be only $892.86 (1000/1.12). If the bond is due in two years at 12 percent, its price would be $797.19 (1000/(1.12<sup class="superscript">2</sup>), and so forth.</p>

Use the future value formula to calculate the sum due upon maturity. For example, a simple loan of $1,000 for one year at 3.5 percent would require the borrower to repay $1,035.00 (1000× 1.035), while a simple loan at the same rate for two years would require a payment of $1,071.23 (1000 × 1.035<sup class="superscript">2</sup>). (Note that the correct answer is not just $35 doubled due to the effects of compounding or capitalizing the interest due at the end of the first year.)</p>

With such loans, which include most auto loans and home mortgages, all payments are equal. There is no big balloon or principal payment at the end because the principal shrinks, slowly at first but more rapidly as the final payment grows nearer, as in <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch04_s04_f01">Figure 4.2 "Sample thirty-year amortizing mortgage"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s05_p11">Calculating yield to maturity for coupon bonds and fixed-payment loans, however, is mathematically nasty business without a computer or bond table. In the past, people used to estimate the yield to maturity on such instruments by pretending they were perpetuities or engaging in trial-and-error interpolation. In the first method, you use the easy perpetuity equation above (<em class="emphasis">i</em> = FV/PV) to get a quick estimate called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">current yield</a><span class="glossdef">A quick (<em class="emphasis">i</em> = FV/PV) but flawed method for calculating interest rates of nonperpetual debt.</span></span>. <em class="emphasis">Unfortunately, current yield can be wide of the mark, especially for bonds with maturities less than twenty years and bonds whose prices are far from their par value</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-wright-fn04_004">Current yield is simply the yield to maturity of a perpetuity, so the more like a perpetuity a bond is, the better the current yield will approximate its yield to maturity. The shorter the maturity of a bond, the less like a Consol it is, so the less accurate the current yield formula will be. Similarly, the current yield works better the closer a bond’s price is to par because yield to maturity equals the coupon rate when the bond is at par. As the price deviates further from par, the less well the current yield can approximate the yield to maturity.</span> In the second method, one backs into the yield to maturity by making successive guesses about <em class="emphasis">i</em> and plugging them into the PV formula. Not fun, but you’ll eventually get there. Most people today therefore use a financial calculator, spreadsheet, or Web-based utility rather than such erroneous (current yield) or laborious (interpolation) processes. You should be able to calculate the yield to maturity of one-year discount bonds or perpetuities by hand, or at worst with the aid of simple (nonfinancial) calculator. Here is a little practice.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s06_p07">So imagine you purchased a 5 percent coupon bond with a $100 face value that matures in three years when the interest rate is 5 percent. As we learned above, the market price of such a bond would equal its face value, or $100. <em class="emphasis">We also learned that bond prices and interest rates are inversely related</em>. As the market interest rate increases, the PV of the bond’s future payments decreases and the bond becomes less valuable. As the rate decreases, the PV of future payments increases and the bond becomes more valuable. If the interest rate increased (decreased) to 6 (4) percent, the value of the bond would decrease (increase), so the returns you earned on the bond would not equal the yield to maturity. For example, suppose you purchased the bond for $100 but its price a year hence stood at $103 because interest rates decreased a little. Your return would be R = (5 + 3)/100 = .08, or 8%. But if in the next year, interest rates soared, driving the market price of the bond down to $65, your return (from purchase) would be R = (10 − 35)/100 = −.25 or negative 25%. Yes, negative. <em class="emphasis">It is quite possible to lose wealth by investing in bonds or other fixed-rate financial instruments, even if there is no default</em> (i.e., even if payments are punctually made as promised). Similarly, if you purchased $1 million worth of municipal bonds that paid coupons of $50,000 annually, your return would not be a simple 5 percent because the market price of the bonds may have gone up or down in the first year. If the bonds lost $100,000 in market value, your return would be a negative 5 percent: R = (50,000 – 100,000)/1,000,000 = −.05. If they gained $100,000, by contrast, your return would be 15 percent: R = (50,000 + 100,000)/1,000,000 = .15. If the bonds gained $100,000 over two years, the total return would be 20 percent because two coupon payments would have been made too: R = (100,000 + 100,000)/1,000,000 = .20.</p>

For most of the 1790s and early 1800s, the price of the 6 percent bonds hovered around par. Given that information, what was the yield to maturity on government debt in that period? What, in general terms, were the prices of the 3 percent and zero coupon bonds?</p>
        <p class="para" id="wright-ch04_s06_p09">The yield to maturity was about 6 percent because the 6 percent coupon bonds traded at around par. The price of the 3 percent coupon bonds must have been well below par because who would pay $100 to get $3 a year when she could pay $100 and get $6 a year? Finally, the zeroes must have appreciated toward the price of the 6 percent coupon bonds as the conversion date neared.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s06_p10"><em class="emphasis">Note that a capital loss or gain is not, repeat not, predicated on actually selling the bond or other asset</em>. One way to think about this is that the rate of return formula merely calculates the return <em class="emphasis">if</em> the bond were to be sold. Another way to think about it is to realize that whether the bond is sold or not, its owner is still poorer (richer) by the amount of the loss (gain) because the value of his assets, and hence his net worth, has shrunk (increased) by that amount. The risk of such loss or gain is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interest rate risk</a><span class="glossdef">The risk that the market price of a bond or other debt instrument will decrease due to increases in the interest rate.</span></span> to distinguish it from other types of risks, like <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">default risk</a><span class="glossdef">The risk that a bond or other debt instrument will not make the promised payments.</span></span> (the risk of nonpayment). Interest rate risk is higher the longer the maturity of a bond because more FVs are affected by increasing the interest rate, and the most distant ones are the most highly affected. Check this out: The PV of $1,000 in 10 years at 5% compounded annually is 1,000/(1.05)<sup class="superscript">10</sup> = $613.91. At 10% it is 1,000/(1.10)<sup class="superscript">10</sup> = $385.54, a loss of 37.2%.

Duration is a technical measure of interest rate risk that we will not investigate here, where the main point is merely that rising interest rates hurt bond prices (and hence bondholders); falling interest rates help bond prices.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="wright-ch04_s07_p01">You might well ask at this point, What factors change interest rates? One big factor is inflation. As the price level rises, so too do interest rates, or at least what economists call nominal interest rates, the type of rates we’ve discussed so far. <em class="emphasis">If nominal rates do not increase (and they often don’t, or can’t), lenders might receive more nominal dollars than they lent but actually get back less purchasing power</em>. Imagine, for example, that you lent $100 for one year at 6 percent interest when a loaf of bread, pack of chewing gum, and two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew each cost $1. At the end of the simple loan, you would get back $100 × 1.06 = $106 and be able to enjoy an extra $6 of goods, say, two loaves of bread, two packs of gum, and two bottles of the caffeine and sugar rush known as Doin’ the Dew. But what if prices doubled over that year? Instead of some combination of 106 goodies, you’d be able to buy only fifty-three. Your nominal return would be positive, but your real return, what you could actually buy with the $106, would be steeply negative.</p>

        <p class="para" id="wright-ch04_s07_p09">Traditionally, inflation expectations were unobservable so real rates were known only ex post. However, relatively new and special types of bonds indexed to inflation, called Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS), provide real interest rate information, allowing market participants to observe ex ante inflation expectations. For example, if the yield to maturity on a regular, nonindexed ten-year Treasury bond is 5 percent, and the yield on the ten-year TIPS is 2 percent, the inflation expectation, via the Fisher Equation π = <em class="emphasis">i</em> − i<sub class="subscript">r</sub>, is 5 −2 = 3 percent. <a class="xref" href="#wright-ch04_s07_f01">Figure 4.5 "U.S. real interest rate, 2001–2010"</a> shows how inflation expectations have waxed and waned since the introduction of TIPS in 1997.</p>

            <li>The difference between the real and the nominal interest rate is literally inflation or inflation expectations.</li>
            <li>According to the Fisher Equation, nominal interest equals real interest plus inflation (or inflation expectations), or real interest equals nominal interest minus inflation (expectations).</li>
            <li>If actual inflation exceeds inflation expectations, real ex post (inflation-adjusted, after the fact) returns on bonds can be negative.</li>
